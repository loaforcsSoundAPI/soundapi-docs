The main SoundAPI thunderstore package no longer contains any reference to LethalCompany. 
Instead a [bindings mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/loaforc/loaforcsSoundAPI_LethalCompany/) is avaliable that contains all the conditions.

> [!NOTE]
> You should depend on the bindings mod as well as SoundAPI

The LethalCompany bindings mod also made breaking changes to be more consistent with the SoundAPI [Naming Convention](/soundpack-tutorials/naming-convention) <br>
e.g: `LethalCompany:player_health` -> `LethalCompany:player:health`
