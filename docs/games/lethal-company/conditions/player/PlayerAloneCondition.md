## Player Alone Condition
Check if the current player is alone. I think this is the same conditions for sanity to go down.

### Properties
| Name | Type | Default |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Value | Boolean | true |

### Usage
```json
{
    "type": "LethalCompany:player:is_alone",
    "value": "false"
}
```
